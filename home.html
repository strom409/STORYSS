                        <h3>Where We Met</h3>
                        <p>We met on Instagram. I added randomly a girl named <strong>Suzain</strong>, and after that I started talking to her. A random Instagram add that changed everything... The moment two souls connected in the digital world. Little did I know that this simple action would lead to the most beautiful chapter of my life. It was fate, it was destiny, it was meant to be.</p>
                        <p>From that first message, I knew there was something special about her. The way she responded, the way she made me feel - it was different from anyone else. She wasn't just another person I met online, she was the person I was meant to find.</p>

                        <h3>First Voice</h3>
                        <p>Late night courage led me to call you for the first time. Your voice became the melody I hum in my dreams. The moment her voice became my world... When words turned into feelings that I never knew existed. That first call was magical - time stood still, and all that mattered was her voice, her laughter, her presence.</p>
                        <p>We talked for hours, and it felt like minutes. Every word she said, every laugh that escaped her lips, every moment of silence - they all meant something. I knew then that this was different, this was real, this was love.</p>

                        <p>In the last 3 days, our chats felt special. Her nickname is <strong>Suzii</strong> and my nickname is <strong>Suhii</strong>. When I knew this feeling was special... The beginning of forever started with simple conversations. Those three days changed everything. We went from strangers to something more, something beautiful, something that felt like home.</p>
                        <p>Every message brought us closer, every conversation deepened our bond. We shared our dreams, our fears, our hopes. We became each other's confidant, each other's support, each other's everything. Those three days were just the beginning of our forever.</p>
