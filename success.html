Darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me

'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowing what it was
I will not give you up this time
But darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own
And in your eyes you're holding mine

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight</pre>

Suzii tum ho, main Suhii
Saath chalna hai, yahi sahi

Pyaar ko lafzon ki zaroorat nahi
Bas ek “hello” se kahaani bani</pre>

                        Suzii, you’re not just a name in my notifications. You’re a soft kind of happiness.
                        If our story started randomly, maybe it’s because destiny likes surprises.

                    <h2>From My Heart</h2>
                    <p>
                        There's something about you that feels different—beautiful in a way words can't capture, unique like a rare melody, impressive in how naturally you touch hearts. When I hear your voice, it's like finding a song I didn't know I was searching for. Your intentions shine through everything you do, pure and genuine, like sunlight breaking through clouds.
                        
                        I find myself thinking about our conversations long after they end, replaying your words like favorite verses. There's a warmth in your presence that makes ordinary moments feel extraordinary. Maybe this is how love begins—not with thunder and lightning, but with quiet moments that slowly build into something unbreakable. Or maybe we're creating a bond so rare and precious that it doesn't need a name, just the certainty of being understood.
                        
                        Whatever this feeling becomes, I know it's real. And I'm grateful for every moment that brings me closer to understanding just how special you are.
